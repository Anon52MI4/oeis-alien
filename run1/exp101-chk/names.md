https://oeis.org/A306210 T(n,k) = binomial(n + k, n) - binomial(n + floor(k/2), n) + 1, square array read by descending antidiagonals (n >= 0, k >= 0).

https://oeis.org/A108427 Number of peaks of the form Ud in all paths from (0,0) to (3n,0) that stay in the first quadrant (but may touch the horizontal axis), consisting of steps u=(2,1), U=(1,2), or d=(1,-1).
